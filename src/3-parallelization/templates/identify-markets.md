Given this investment context: "{{ marketContext }}"

Identify {{ numMarkets }} markets or sectors that would be most positively affected by this context.

Then identify {{ numAdditionalMarkets }} additional markets that could benefit but might be overlooked by typical analysts - think second-order effects, supply chains, enabling technologies, or indirect beneficiaries.

Return a list of market/sector names ({{ numMarkets }} + {{ numAdditionalMarkets }} total).

Focus on publicly traded equity markets with good liquidity.

Return only the array of market names, nothing else.
